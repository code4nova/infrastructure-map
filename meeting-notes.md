# Project notes

## About

This project's goal is to highlight the complexity and expense needed to fix all the crumbling infrastructure. Rather than celebrate the recent Infrastructure bill as a success, Dr. Hubbard aims to drive the narrative in a more realistic direction. $500bn is not enough compared to the sheer scope of what needs to be fixed in our nation.
